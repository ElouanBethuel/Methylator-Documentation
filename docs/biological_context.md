# Biological Context


Epigenetic marks regulate gene transcription, as well as genome replication, and repair. In mammals, DNA methylation on CpGs was shown to be
essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, repression of
transposable elements, aging, and carcinogenesis.

In cancer cells, global hypomethylation at repetitive sequences might cause genetic instability, whereas site-speciﬁc CpG island
promoter hypermethylation could lead to silencing of TSGs
