# Methylator, a DNA methylation analysis workflow

<small>Maintained by [BiBs](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com). Last update : 25/04/2024. Methylator v0.1. </small>  

Methylator is a complete Snakemake workï¬‚ow to analyse DNA methylation data. Methylator runs in a dedicated Apptainer image to allow for reproducibility and was optimized to compute effciently the data on HPC clusters such as the ones from the IFB and iPOP-UP networks. We aim to make those complex analyses do able by biologists with no or little bioinformatics background.

Implemented by [BiBs-EDC](https://parisepigenetics.github.io/bibs/), this workflow for DNA methylation data analysis runs effectively on both IFB and iPOP-UP clusters. If you encounter troubles or need additional tools or features, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/parisepigenetics/Methylator/issues), email directly [BiBs](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com), or pass by the 366b room.
