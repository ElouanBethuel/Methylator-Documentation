Implemented by [BiBs-EDC](https://parisepigenetics.github.io/bibs/), this workflow for DNA methylation data analysis runs effectively on both IFB and iPOP-UP clusters. If you encounter troubles or need additional tools or features, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/parisepigenetics/Methylator/issues), email directly [BiBs](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com), or pass by the 366b room.
