#  Select cluster profile

A configuration file with the specifity of your cluster is needed. It has to be named `configs/cluster_config.yaml`. Preconfigurated files are available for IFB and iPOP-UP clusters. 

For IFB, you should type:    
```
cp configs/cluster_config_ifb.yaml configs/cluster_config.yaml
```
For iPOP-UP:    
```
cp configs/cluster_config_ipop.yaml configs/cluster_config.yaml
```
!!! warning 
    For other clusters, edit your own `cluster_config.yaml` file, and don't hesitate to contact your sysadmin for help.
