# Adapt the workflow to your cluster
A configuration file with the specifity of your cluster is needed. It has to be named `configs/cluster_config.yaml`. Predefined files are available for IFB and iPOP-UP clusters. 

For IFB, you should type:    
```
cp configs/cluster_config_ifb.yaml configs/cluster_config.yaml
```
For iPOP-UP:    
```
cp configs/cluster_config_ipop.yaml configs/cluster_config.yaml
```
!!! warning 
    For other clusters, you have to edit the file yourself
